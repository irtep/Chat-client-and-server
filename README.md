# Chat-client-and-server
Basic, but working html-css-javascript-php-mySQL chat client with server. Using database to save and show messages. One of my earlier works, so forgive me if bad documentation etc. 

1. Be sure to modificate to .PHP file your own mySQL username, password and database name to match your sql-database.
2. index.htm to folder and make additional folders there where you put your php, js and css files.
3. Should work then. Enjoy chatting with your friends or modificate to match your needs.
